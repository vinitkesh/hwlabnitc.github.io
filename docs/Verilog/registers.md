# **Introduction To Registers**

## **Registers**
A register is a collection of flip-flops that are edge triggered. Registers 
capture and store data based on a trigger- either a rising or falling edge. 
Registers are crucial for CPUs as they serve as temporary data storage 
elements. To code for a register using behavioural modelling in Verilog, it is 
expected of us to mimic the behaviour of a register using a variable such 
that it is assigned a value and stores it until the next edge triggering. We 
shall discuss how to implement a register using D flip-flops as well. 
 
The reg datatype in Verilog is used to declare variables which model data 
storage elements, they store the value assigned to them and can represent 
either combinational or sequential logic.   
To design a simple 4-bit register in Verilog in which only 1 operation – read 
or write is allowed at a time, we need to declare:   
`1`.  A reg variable with the required number of bits (4 in this case) to act as 
our register.   
`2`.  A read/write signal as input (one or multiple depending on whether the 
question permits more than one operation to be performed at a time).   
`3`.  A reset signal which enables us to reset the value in the register to 0- it 
can be active high or low.   
`4`.  Input ports: write_data for the data to be written, read_address and 
write_address (both are not necessary here since we write to only 1 register but we'll see them in register files).

`5`. Output port: read_data, write to it when the read/write signal is high and 
read its value when the read/write signal is low.

```v
module register(input clk, rst, rw, 
                input [3:0] write_data, 
                output [3:0] read_data); 
    
    reg [3:0] block; 
    always@(posedge clk) begin 
        if(!rst)   block <= 0; 
        else begin 
            if(rw==1) block <= write_data; 
            else read_data <= block; 
        end 
    end 
endmodule
```  

:::


Since we have written our read logic in the else block, even if the rw 
signal is any value other than 0 or 1 at the beginning we just read the 
register displaying its contents, which is ‘x’ initially. This is to avoid 
unintentionally writing a value, giving read operation a higher priority 
over write. You can initialize the block reg to 0 too (it can depend on the 
question).  

If we have a register with multiple read and write ports, the question will 
mention certain specifications for e.g.  reads can occur parallelly but not 
writes. To demonstrate how to go about coding for such a question, let 
us see an example of a 4-bit register with 1 read ports and 2 write ports. 
A read and write operation cannot occur simultaneously but we can have 
2 such writes and every time we write to the register, we alternately use 
either of the write ports. Initially, when we perform a write operation, we write into the register with write_data_1, the next time with 
write_data_2, etc.

module reg_wr(input clk, 
              input rst, 
              input rw, 
              input[15:0] data1, data2, 
              output reg [15:0] read); 
    // perform writ1 & writ2 alternatively 
    reg [15:0] block; 
    reg track=0; 
    always@(posedge clk) begin 
        if(rst==0) begin // reset is active low 
            read <= 0; 
        end 
        else if(rw==0) begin // write 
            if(track==0) begin 
                block <= data1; 
                track <= 1; 
            end 
            else begin 
                block <= data2; 
                track <= 0; 
            end 
        end 
        else begin // read 
            read <= block; 
        end 
    end 
endmodule
```  
:::
To design a register using flip-flops, let’s consider the first example 
wherein we had a 4-bit register with one read and write port. 
We instantiate four D flip-flops and assign the incoming input as input to 
the flip-flops if the rw signal is high, else we assign the contents of the 
flip-flop to the output variable. Note that in case of the write operation, 
the output variable reflects the previously read/stored value.

```v
module dflfl(output reg op, input ip, input clk); 
    always @(posedge clk) begin 
        op <= ip; 
    end 
endmodule 
   
module four_bit_reg(output reg [3:0] out, input [3:0] ip, input clk, input rw); 
    reg [3:0]intermed;  
    reg [3:0]temp; 
    
    dflfl g1(temp[3], rw ? ip[3]:temp[3], clk); 
    dflfl g2(temp[2], rw ? ip[2]:temp[2], clk); 
    dflfl g3(temp[1], rw ? ip[1]:temp[1], clk); 
    dflfl g4(temp[0], rw ? ip[0]:temp[0], clk); 
   
    always @(*) begin 
        if(rw==1'b1) intermed <= temp; // storing previous value in intermed 
    end 
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin 
        if(rw==1'b1) out <= intermed; // if a write occurs then previously read value is displayed 
        else out <= temp; // else in case of a read 
    end 
endmodule 
```
:::

When we instantiate the D flip-flops, we check whether the rw signal is 
high i.e. whether a write is occurring to pass the input to it. Since we 
cannot mix case and if else statements with our combinational block i.e. 
we cannot instantiate the dffs conditionally (Verilog does not support 
this), the dffs will therefore be instantiated at every rising edge transition 
and so for a read operation, we pass it dummy data which would be the 
previously written (currently stored) value.

## **Register Files**
Register Files contain an array of registers. Hence there is a need for read 
and write address inputs to ascertain which register to read from or write data into.  
Ports are input and output signals. When a question mentions that the 
register has to have multiple read ports or multiple write ports- this 
means that there are several read_address, write_address and 
write_data ports- we can perform more than 1 operation at the same 
time on different registers within the register file. There are several cases 
to consider in such questions- if a question permits multiple writes at the 
same time, you need to think of the possibility of more than one 
operation attempting to write to the same register, or if a read and write 
can occur together, you need to think of the possibility of an operation 
attempting to read from and another attempting to write to the same 
register. So assigning priorities is important. More than one read 
operation occurring simultaneously won’t create a problem.   
Let’s look at the code for a register file with 8 registers capable of storing 
8-bit data each. It has 2 read ports and 1 write port. Two reads are permitted simultaneously, however only read or write is allowed at a 
time.   
::: details View Code
```v
module reg_file(input clk, rst, 
                input [1:0]r1r2w, 
                input[2:0] port1, 
                input[2:0] port2, 
                input [2:0] port3, 
                input [7:0] data, 
                output reg [7:0] read1, read2); 
  
    reg [WIDTH-1:0] block[WIDTH-1:0]; 
    // 2 read ports, 1 write port 
    always@(posedge clk) begin 
    // r1r2w- 0: write case  
    // r1r2w- 1: read1 case  
    // r1r2w- 2: read2 case  
    // r1r2w- 3: read1 & read2 case  
        if(rst==0) begin 
            read1 <= 0; 
            read2 <= 0; 
        end 
        else if(r1r2w == 0) begin // write 
            block[port1] <= data; 
        end 
        else if(r1r2w == 1) begin  
            read1 <= block[port2]; 
        end 
        else if(r1r2w == 2) begin 
            read2 <= block[port3];  
        end 
        else begin 
            read1 <= block[port2]; 
            read2 <= block[port3]; 
        end 
    end 
endmodule
```
:::

We declare a r1r2w signal because we are permitted to perform two 
reads but a read and write cannot occur simultaneously. Besides the 
ports, we declare an array of eight eight-bit registers in Verilog in this 
format: reg [x:0] block [y:0] where you declare the number of bits of 
each register before the variable name ‘block’ and the number of array 
elements i.e. registers after block.  

Here's a pictorial representation of the register file:  
<img src="/img/registers-image-0041.png"></img>  
If we are permitted to perform multiple write operations, then we must assign 
priorities to the write ports. We can do this by structuring our if else blocks in a 
favourable manner.   

Let’s assume that we have eight eight-bit registers contained in a register file 
that has 1 read port and 2 write ports. Similar to the last example, we cannot 
have a read and write operation at once but we can perform both write 
operations simultaneously. In case two writes try to access the same register, 
give priority to write_data_1.

    end

**Q:** Can you take the previous example and modify it such that the register file 
now has 2 read ports and 2 write ports and any pair of operations can occur 
simultaneously? Let the read operation be of higher priority when a read and 
write occur simultaneously, and if two operations attempt to write to the same 
register, let the one with the lower serial number e.g. write_data_1 over 
write_data_2 be of higher priority.  

## **Shift Registers**
Shift registers are a cascade of flip-flops used to store values which are 
passed on to the consecutive register at every edge triggering.  They are 
used for temporary data storage, data transfer and data manipulation. 
Here is an example of a SISO (Serial In, Serial Out) type shift register:   
Assuming that the ffs are initialized to store a value of 0. Data can be 
serially shifted to the left or right, in this example we shift to the right.
<img src="/img/registers-image-0053.png"></img>  

|CLK Transition | D | Q1 | Q2 | Q_out|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|↑|1|1|0|0|
|↑|1|1|1|0|
|↑|0|0|1|1|
|↑|0|0|0|1|
|↑|1|1|0|0|
|↑|0|0|1|0|

This example shown above is that of a SISO shift register wherein there is only 
1 (serial) input and 1 output each such that the data is stored and shifted bit by 
bit sequentially either leftwards or rightwards.  

Other types of shift registers include:  
`1.` **SIPO: Serial In, Parallel Out (One input, outputs Qi where i=1,2,..,n for 
each of the n flipflops)**  
<img src="/img/registers-image-0057.png">  

|CLK Transition | D | Q1 | Q2 | Q_out|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|↑|1|1|0|0|
|↑|1|1|1|0|
|↑|0|0|1|1|
|↑|0|0|0|1|
|↑|1|1|0|0|
|↑|0|0|1|0|

output Q_out)**

outputs at each ff)**

|CLK Transition | D1 | D2 | D3 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|↑|1|0|1|1|0|1|
|↑|1|0|0|1|0|0|
|↑|0|0|1|0|0|1|
|↑|0|0|0|0|0|0|
|↑|1|1|1|1|1|1|
|↑|0|1|0|0|1|0|  

Let’s look at the design of a 4-bit shift register (SISO) in Verilog:

::: details View Code
```v
module shift_reg(input clk, en, in, output reg out); 
    reg [3:0] sreg; 
    integer i; 
    
    always@(posedge clk) begin 
        if(en) begin 
            for(i=0; i<3; i++) begin 
                sreg[i+1] <= sreg[i]; 
                sreg[0] <= in; 
            end  
            out <= sreg[15]; 
        end 
    end 
endmodule
```  
:::

When the EN signal is active, the shift register operates according to SISO logic; 
however, when the EN signal is inactive, no shifting or alteration occurs.   
If we were to implement a 4-bit shift register (SISO) with D flip-flops 
(hierarchical modelling), it would look like this:  

::: details View Code
```v
module dflfl(output reg op, input ip, input clk); 
    always @(posedge clk) begin 
        op <= ip; 
    end 
endmodule 
   
module siso(output reg [3:0] out, 
            input ip, 
            input clk,en); 
   reg [3:0] temp; 
   
   dflfl g1(out[3], en ? ip:out[3], clk); 
   dflfl g2(out[2], en ? out[3]:out[2], clk); 
   dflfl g3(out[1], en ? out[2]:out[1], clk); 
   dflfl g4(out[0], en ? out[1]:out[0], clk); 
   
 endmodule
```
:::

This is an example of a shift right SISO shift register wherein the input gets 
serially shifted to the right at every positive edge triggering. The combinational 
block involves instantiation of four D flip-flops and applying the serial shifting 
logic by passing the input to the MSB flip-flop. The inputs to the other flip-flops 
are the outputs of the flip-flops preceding them. If the enable signal is low, we 
freeze the current values and we don’t make any changes. 

**Q:** Attempt to design a bidirectional shift register in Verilog.  
We need to have two modes- shift left and shift right, and so we have an 
additional input control signal.  
Try it out and see if you can implement it in code.  
**Q.** Attempt to design a 4-bit SIPO shift register in Verilog. What changes would 
you have to make to the SISO code and what additional input and output 
signals would you have to include?  

## **Some useful short notes**
**1. A note on parameterization:**
The code that we write for n-bit registers is limited for registers which are 
strictly n-bits. In order to write code and design registers that are more 
reusable, that can accommodate an arbitrary number of bits for each 
instantiation, we can utilize instantiation parameters. We can pass the required 
value of the parameter at the time of instantiation and we can also specify a 
default value.

    always@(posedge clk) begin 
        if(!rst)   block <= 0; 
        else begin

The syntax for parametrizing a module is:   
*module module_name #(parameter PARAMETER_NAME =default_value)
